Usage
=====
Have a look at the test class provided for an example usage.


Advantages
==========
I find it tedious to rewrite the same kind of queries for similar objects. I built this DAO for myself. 
Perhaps someone will find it useful.

Feel free to modify it to suit your needs.

It saves me the effort of writing same queries again and again. Instead, I only need to write queries
which are rather unique. Overtime, I expect, to flesh this out more as I observe my usage patterns.
